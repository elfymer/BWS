		    <p>Welcome to Bengga (“Bengga,” “we,” “us” or “our”). Bengga provides a fun way to share and compare experiences using Photo Topics and Photo Replies. To start or join a Photo Topic, just select a photo or video and add a caption.</p>
		    <p>Our Privacy Policy sets out how Bengga may collect, use, share and protect any information that you provide in relation to our mobile services, website and any software provided on or in connection with Bengga Services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>
		    <p>By using our Service, you confirm that you understand and agree that we are providing a platform where you can post photos, videos, captions, comments and other materials (“User Content”) to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the Terms and Conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
		    <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all Users, visitors, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
		    <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all Users, visitors, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
			<p>The following outlines our Privacy Policy:</p>
			<p><ul>
			  	<li>We will communicate the purposes for which information is being collected before or at the time of collecting the information.</li>
			    <li>We will collect and use personal information solely for the purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes.</li>
			    <li>We will retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill those specified purposes.</li>
			    <li>We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the User concerned.</li>
			    <li>We will use reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification to protect personal information of Users.</li>
			    <li>We will make information regarding our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information readily available to Users.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<h3><strong>Collection of Information</strong></h3>
			<p> We collect the following types of information:</p>
			<p><em>A.  Information You Provide Us Directly</em></p>
				<p>
			 	<ol>
				    <li>When you install the Bengga App and register for the Service, you will be asked to provide your username, password, and email address.
				    </li>
			   		<li>You will be asked to provide us with your phone number and to allow us access to your mobile device’s address book.  A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (excluding all other information such as email and birthdays in your address book)  will be stored in our servers and will only be used to:
			   			<ul>
			   				<li>notify you when your contacts register in Bengga; and,</li>
			      			<li>indicate which of your contacts are already registered in Bengga.
							</li>
						</ul>       
					</li>
			        <li>Profile information that you provide for your User profile (e.g., display name, picture)</li>
			       	<li>User Content (e.g., photos, videos, Action Tags, captions, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service</li>
			   	</ol>  
			   	</p> 
			<p><em>B.  Analytics Information</em></p>
			<p>Bengga uses Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and report usage trends for the Service.  These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the App pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service.  We collect and use this analytics information with those from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
			<p><em>C.  Cookies and Similar Technologies</em></p>
			<p> Bengga may place a "cookie" on the browser of your computer.  Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and many major websites use them to provide useful features to their customers.  The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the Bengga site.  We use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of features, so that Bengga can customize delivery of information specific to your interests without compromising privacy. </p>
			       
			<p><h3><strong>Use of Information</strong></h3></p>
			<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information described in the previous sections of this Policy, we may use information that you provide to:</p>
			    <ul>
			      	<li>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in;</li>
				    <li>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Service;</li>
				    <li>provide personalized content and information to you and others;</li>
				    <li>provide, improve, test and monitor the effectiveness of our Service;</li>
				    <li>monitor and analyze usage metrics such as total number of active Users, traffic and demographic patterns; and,</li>
				    <li>diagnose and fix technological problems.</li>
			    </ul>
			       
			<p><h3><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</strong></h3></p>
			<p>We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the User with any third-parties, except as specifically described herein.  We may disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to:</p>
			    <ul>
			       	<li>comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</li>
			        <li>protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or,</li>
			        <li>act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users of our Service or members of the public.</li>
			    </ul>
			<p>We may share User Content and information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Bengga is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates").  Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (which may include providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (which may include providing you with better and more relevant experiences).  These Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your User Content.</p>
			<p> We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers").  Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
			<p> Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set.  You can only set photos and videos to private, but your profile information can be viewed publicly.  Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others and Bengga.</p>
			       
			<p><h3><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h3></p>
			<p> Bengga and its related Services are not intended and designed to attract anyone under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally and knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13.  The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13.  We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental consent.</p>
			       
			<p><h3><strong>Security</strong></h3></p>
			<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure.  In order to prevent misuse, loss and unauthorized access and disclosure, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect personal information.  Personal information is stored on our servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
			       
			<p><h3><strong>Changes to Policy</strong></h3></p>
			<p> Bengga may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We reserve the right to revise this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without prior notice.  However, we will not use your personal information in a way that is materially different from the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.  We will post the revised Policy on the Bengga website, so that Users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed.  You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.  Your continued use of Bengga indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy.  If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Bengga App, or any part of its Service.</p>
